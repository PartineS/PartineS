## about me

i am a computer engineering graduate with a strong academic and practical background in  
**software development**, **database systems**, **computer networks**, and **cyber security**.

throughout my education, i have focused on understanding not only how systems work,  
but also **why they fail**, **how they are attacked**, and **how they can be secured**.

my approach is analytical, disciplined, and detail-oriented, shaped by both academic  
training and hands-on technical practice.
