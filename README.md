## profile

I am a student with an academic and practice-oriented focus on **Network Engineering** and **Cyber Security**.  
My primary interests lie in **network infrastructure**, **secure network design**, and **defensive security concepts**, supported by systematic laboratory work and simulations.

My learning approach emphasizes structured experimentation:  
analysis, configuration, controlled failure, troubleshooting, and documentation.

## technical background

I have hands-on experience with **Cisco-based network environments**, including the design, configuration, and troubleshooting of small to medium-scale network topologies.  
My work primarily involves laboratory-based scenarios that simulate real-world networking challenges using industry-standard tools.

## projects and laboratories

My repositories mainly consist of:
- network design and simulation projects  
- routing and switching laboratories  
- security-focused experiments  
- structured Packet Tracer and Linux-based practice environments  

All projects are documented with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and learning outcomes.
