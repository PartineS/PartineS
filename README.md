## About Me

**Location:** Istanbul, Turkey  
**Status:** Student  

I am a student focusing on network engineering and cyber security, with a strong interest in
network infrastructure, defense mechanisms, and secure system design.  
My learning approach is practice-oriented, combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on
labs and simulations.

### Focus Areas
- Network Engineering and Network Infrastructure  
- Cyber Security and Network Defense  
- Database Security  

### Background
Hands-on experience with **Cisco-based network environments**, including network design,
configuration, and troubleshooting from basic to advanced scenarios through structured
labs and simulations.

### Collaboration
Open to learning-focused projects, network lab studies, and CTF teams.
